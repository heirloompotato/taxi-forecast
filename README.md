## 🚕 Problem Statement & Business Relevance

**Taxi availability** acts as a useful proxy for urban transport **demand and supply dynamics**. Understanding how availability shifts based on time, weather, and location can help:

- **Consumers**: Anticipate peak periods and plan ahead when booking a taxi or ride-hailing service.
- **Transport Operators**: Optimize driver deployment and reduce passenger wait times.
- **Urban Planners & Government Agencies**: Gain insights into commuter behavior and demand hotspots to inform mobility policy or infrastructure planning.
- **Logistics & Delivery Firms**: Strategize dispatching by aligning with short-term traffic and transport flow.

This tool showcases how **open transport data** can be combined with **cloud infrastructure** and **machine learning** to produce actionable insights in a scalable and reproducible manner.
